Overview
Beneath the cables and blinking lights of modern computing lies a vital foundation - local area networks (LANs) that quietly power connectivity and collaboration. This course unpacks the essentials of LANs by guiding learners through both theory and hands-on workstation installation.

Description
This course introduces the core principles and components of Local Area Networks (LANs), offering a practical understanding of their purpose, configurations, protocols, and transport media. Learners will gain experience by installing a networked workstation, adhering to manufacturer and industry standards. They will also learn to troubleshoot issues, document installations in line with organisational requirements, and maintain professional workplace standards. Designed for those entering IT support or network administration, the course builds foundational knowledge and practical skills for working within modern networked environments.
