Overview
The way you design your brand will impact a customer's decision to work with you. The basics of branding are the starting point for developing a strong, consistent image and reputation to take your business to the next level.

Description
Your brand is the starting point for all strategic planning. When you design a brand from the ground up, you are also defining the direction you will take in your marketing efforts. Let your brand be your backbone. Think of it as your blueprint for future advertising and marketing. If you are consistent and loyal to your brand in everything you do, you will pave a straight path, where each choice put in front of you will have a more obvious answer for you to put your creative confidence in. Stay true to your brand in all decision making and the decision will also be clearer in the minds of your customers. When you're consistent with your brand, you drive a more powerful connection with like-minded people. A connection that will be remembered.
