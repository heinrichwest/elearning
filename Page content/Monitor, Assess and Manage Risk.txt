Overview
Risk surrounds every project, process, and decision — some visible, others hidden beneath layers of routine. This course draws that uncertainty into the open, showing how to face risk not with fear, but with strategy, foresight, and preparation.

Description
This course equips learners with the knowledge and practical tools to identify, assess, and manage risk effectively within an organisational setting. Beginning with the fundamental concepts of risk and the internal and external factors that influence it, the course progresses to evaluating critical processes and identifying potential risk scenarios. Learners will explore risk impact analysis, prioritisation methods, and the development of tailored contingency plans. Emphasis is placed on aligning risk management practices with organisational policies and procedures, as well as effective communication and storage protocols. The course concludes with testing, reviewing, and improving contingency strategies, enabling participants to build resilience and respond confidently when risks materialise.
