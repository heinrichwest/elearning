Communication and Interpersonal skills
Overview
Clear and purposeful communication is essential for effective interaction in professional and personal contexts. This course provides learners with the analytical and practical skills to engage confidently in spoken or signed communication, evaluate oral texts critically, and manage discussions constructively. Through a structured exploration of communication techniques, audience engagement, and evaluative methods, learners will become more articulate, perceptive, and adaptive in various interactive settings.

Description
This course focuses on the development and evaluation of oral or signed communication in individual and group contexts. Learners will explore how to interpret, manage, and respond to complex discussions while adapting tone, style, and register appropriately. The course places emphasis on evaluating spoken or signed texts, identifying subtext, bias, and rhetorical techniques, and understanding the impact of body language and delivery. It also delves into how speakers influence and guide interactions, manage conflict, and sustain dialogue in challenging situations. By course end, participants will be able to plan, deliver, and assess communication with clarity, purpose, and insight.


Unit 1: Respond critically, yet sensitively as a listener/audience
1. Responses show a clearly developed understanding of complex issues under discussion in one-on-one or group situations. Own understanding is clarified and further developed during discussions and opportunity is provided during interactions for the clarification of one another's understanding. 2. Discussions and/or conflicts are managed sensitively and in a manner that supports the goal of group or one-on-one interaction. 3. Characteristics of a speaker's/signer's style and tone/register that attract or alienate an audience are identified with reference to the particular effect of each feature in creating audience response. 3.The underlying assumptions, points of view and subtexts in spoken/signed texts are identified and challenged when appropriate to clarify understanding, remove bias and/or sustain interaction.

Unit 2: Analyse own responses to spoken/signed texts and adjust as required
1. Own responses to spoken/signed texts are analysed in relation to audience, purpose and context. Inappropriate responses are identified and adjusted accordingly. 2. When confronted by opposing views, own position is put forward with confidence in a manner appropriate to the interaction. 3. Tone/register, approach or style is appropriate to context, and is adapted to maintain oral/signed interaction when it breaks down or is difficult to initiate or maintain. Pedantic, illogical or aggressive language is identified and modified to sustain interaction.

Unit 3: Use strategies to be an effective speaker/signer in sustained oral/signed interactions
1. Planning of content and presentation techniques is evident in formal communications. 2. The impact of non-verbal cues/body language and signals on audiences is analysed and used appropriately. 3. The influence of rhetorical devices is analysed and used for effect on an audience.


Unit 4: Evaluate spoken/signed discourse
1. Points of view in spoken/signed texts are identified and meaning described in relation to context and purpose of the interaction. 2. Values, attitudes and assumptions in discourse are identified and their influence on the interaction described. 3. Techniques used by speakers/signers to evade or dissipate responsibility for an issue are identified and interpretations of the text reflect this insight. 4. The impact (e.g. clarity of purpose, speaker's/signer's capability) is described, explained and judged.
