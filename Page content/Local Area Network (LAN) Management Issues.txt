Overview
Efficient management of a Local Area Network (LAN) is critical to maintaining the performance, security, and reliability of an organisation’s IT infrastructure. This course equips learners with the knowledge and skills to manage network resources, control access, optimise performance, and protect against security threats. Learners will explore practical approaches to monitoring and maintaining a LAN, addressing both technical and operational challenges.

Description
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the issues affecting the management of a Local Area Network (LAN). Learners begin by exploring access management, identifying network resources whose access can be controlled, determining access levels for different user categories, and evaluating methods for enforcing access restrictions. The purpose and use of access audit trails are examined to ensure accountability and compliance with organisational policies. The course then focuses on LAN performance, addressing factors that affect response times and the need for continuous monitoring and problem identification. Learners will explore diagnostic tools for collecting performance data, and compare different methods for improving network performance, evaluating their effects on overall efficiency. By the end of the course, learners will be able to manage a LAN effectively, optimising access, performance, and security while addressing the operational challenges associated with network administration.
